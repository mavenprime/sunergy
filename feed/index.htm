										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our team of home remodeling contractors have helped countless homeowners like you in the Los Angeles area save money by going green. In fact, there are a number of different opportunities that you can take advantage of to start saving money and doing your part for the environment.<span id="more-109"></span></p>
<p><span id="more-1659"></span></p>
<p>If you aren’t sure where to begin, our team of remodeling contractors can walk you through some of the various projects available to you to help simplify the process and make sure you get everything you need in one convenient location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Solar Panel Installation</strong></p>
<p>Because the Los Angeles area gets so much sun, many people are turning to solar panel installation to help them start saving money around their home. Not only can a solar system help you reduce costs, but it can also help protect the environment at the same time. These systems are capable of generating and storing 5kW+ of energy each day, thus helping cut your energy bill in half. Imagine what you could do with all of that extra money each month.</p>
<p>Our team of solar panel contractors has helped countless individuals in Orange County save money within the very next month after installation is complete. The process is simple, and we work hard to get everything done and installed within a relatively short amount of time.</p>
<p><strong>Interior Improvements</strong></p>
<p>While solar panels are something you can do to improve the outside of your home, there are plenty of things that you can do for the inside of your Ventura County home to help get things moving in the right direction as well. In fact, many of them are relatively inexpensive and don’t take very long for you to do either. For example, swapping out the lightbulbs in your home for an energy-efficient bulb can go a long way in saving money and protecting the environment as well.</p>
<p>You can also take out your existing appliances and replace them for the energy-efficient model. There are different systems, refrigerators, ovens, dishwashers, humidifiers and much more all available in a more efficient model. In fact, you can often find more energy-efficient electronics as well. Just ask the salesman at the big box store near you about some of the more environmentally friendly options on the market for you.</p>
<p>By making some of the changes above, you could be on your way to saving more than you ever imagined each month. Take the time to speak with our home remodeling contractors in Los Angeles today about how you can begin saving money. At Sunergy, we will work hard to make sure you are able to save money and make your home more energy-efficient. With years of experience in the field, we know what it takes to make your home as energy-efficient as possible. Just ask us about some of the different options available to you today.</p>
